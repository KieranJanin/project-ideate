[Challenge]: Design a new mobile banking experience for freelance workers...

[Director 🎬]: Team, our challenge is clear. Anthropologist, please provide your initial observations on the freelance experience.

[Anthropologist 🧑]: Based on my analysis, freelancers experience high anxiety due to unpredictable income streams. They struggle to forecast their finances and often get surprised by large, irregular tax bills. The core human need is for 'financial peace of mind'.

[Experience Architect 🏗️]: That's a powerful insight. To address 'financial peace of mind,' I propose a concept called 'Flow'. It would automatically partition a percentage of every incoming payment into a separate 'Tax Vault', making savings effortless.

[The Critic 🧐]: An interesting start, but does 'Flow' account for variable income? If a freelancer has a low-income month, a fixed percentage might be too aggressive and cause a cash-flow crisis. The system needs to be adaptive.

[Storyteller 📜]: A valid point. We can frame the story around that adaptiveness. "Meet 'Flow,' the intelligent financial co-pilot that smooths out the peaks and valleys of freelance life. It understands your income and adjusts your savings, so you're always prepared, never surprised."
