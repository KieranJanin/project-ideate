# Persona MCP tools

Here's a breakdown of potential tools for each of the "10 Faces of Innovation" personas, focusing on how they could leverage MCP (Micro-Agent Communication Protocol) to interact with various software solutions. The idea is that the agent, acting as a persona, would call these tools, and the tools, in turn, would interact with the specified software via APIs or other integration methods. üõ†Ô∏èü§ù
