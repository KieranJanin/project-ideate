# Setting Up and Configuring Firebase Hosting

This document outlines the steps required to set up and deploy the Project IDEATE web application using Firebase Hosting.

## Prerequisites

*   A Google account.
*   A Firebase project created in the Firebase console.
*   Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
*   Access to the project's files.

## Steps

### 1. Install the Firebase CLI

If you haven't already, install the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) globally using npm:

```
bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
### 2. Log in to Firebase

Log in to your Firebase account through the CLI:
```
bash
firebase login
```
This will open a browser window asking you to authenticate and grant Firebase CLI access to your Firebase projects.

### 3. Initialize Your Firebase Project

Navigate to the root directory of your project in your terminal:
```
bash
cd path/to/your/project-ideate
```
Initialize Firebase for your project. When prompted, select "Hosting" as the feature you want to set up.

```
bash
firebase init
```
The CLI will guide you through the setup process. Key steps include:

*   **Selecting a Firebase project:** Choose the Firebase project you created earlier from the list.
*   **Specifying your public directory:** This is the directory containing your static web files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). For this project, your public directory is likely `src` (referencing the structure and the location of `index.html`). Enter `src` when prompted.
*   **Configuring as a single-page application:** Since `index.html` serves as the main entry point, configure it as a single-page application. When asked if you want to configure as a single-page app, type `y` and press Enter. When asked which file to use for your index file, accept the default (`index.html`).
*   **Setting up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub (Optional):** You can choose to set this up if you want continuous deployment.

This process will create a `firebase.json` file in the root of your project and a `.firebaserc` file.

### 4. Understand `firebase.json`

The `firebase.json` file is crucial for configuring Firebase Hosting. It specifies which files in your project should be deployed and how they should be handled. The initialization step will create a basic configuration. Ensure the `public` property in this file is set to `src`, matching the directory containing your web files:

```
json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "src",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
The `rewrites` section is important for single-page applications as it ensures that all requests are served by your `index.html` file, allowing your frontend routing (if any) to handle different paths.

### 5. Deploy Your Project

Once you have initialized your project and confirmed your `firebase.json` is configured correctly, you can deploy your site:
```
bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
The CLI will upload the files from your specified public directory (`src`) to Firebase Hosting. After the deployment is complete, the CLI will provide you with the Hosting URL where your project is live.

### 6. Verify Deployment and Configuration

Open the Hosting URL provided by the CLI in your web browser to ensure your application is deployed correctly. Verify that all assets are loading and that the application functions as expected. This includes confirming that the frontend JavaScript can communicate with your backend server (which needs to be running separately or also deployed).
